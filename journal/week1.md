# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp - WEEK 1

## Fixing Git Tags

If you have inadvertantly tagged a git branch and want to correct it, then you must have to change it locally and then remotely. 

To delete a specific `tag locally` ====> 

```
git tag -d 0.4.0

or 

git tag -d <tag_name>
```

To delete `tag remotely` ====>

```
git push --delete origin 0.4.0

OR

git push --delete origin <tag_name>
```

Now go to your commit history and grab the `SHA` of that commit that you want to `retag`. 

```
git checkout <SHA>
git tag Major.Minor.Patch
git push --tags
git checkout main
```

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else.
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defined required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules
```

[Standard Module Structure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure)

## Terraform and Input variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag
We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_ud="my-user_id"`

### var -file flag

The -var-file flag is used to pass Input Variable values into Terraform plan and apply commands using a file that contains the values

### terraform.tvfars

This is the default file to load in terraform variables in blunk

### auto.tfvars

Terraform auto loads tfvars files only when they are named terraform.tfvars or terraform.tfvars.json

### Order of Terraform Variables

Terraform follows the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones (ascending -> descending): 

- Environment variables
- The terraform.tfvars file, if present.
- The terraform.tfvars.json file, if present.
- Any *.auto.tfvars or *.auto.tfvars.json files, processed in lexical order of their filenames.
- Any -var and -var-file options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)

## Dealing With Configuration Drift

## What happens if we lose our state file?

If you lose your statefile, you most likley have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually.

You can use terraform port but it won't for all cloud resources. You need check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)
[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and delete or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps. 

If we run **Terraform plan** again, it will attempt to put our infrstraucture back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift


## Fix using Terraform Refresh

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only -auto-approve
```

## Terraform Modules

### Terraform Module Structure

It is recommend to place modules in a `modules` directory when locally developing modules but you can name it whatever you like.

### Passing Input Variables

We can pass input variables to our module.
The module has to declare the terraform variables in its own variables.tf

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

### Modules Sources

Using the source we can import the module from various places eg:
- locally
- Github
- Terraform Registry

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
}
```

## Considerations when using ChatGPT to write Terraform

LLMs such as ChatGPT may not be trained on the latest documentation or information about Terraform.

It may likely produce older examples that could be deprecated. Often affecting providers.

## Working with files in Terraform


### Fileexists function

This is a built in terraform function to check the existance of a file.

```tf
condition = fileexists(var.error_html_filepath)
```

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/fileexists

### Filemd5

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/filemd5

### Path Variable

In terraform there is a special variable called `path` that allows us to reference local paths:
- path.module = get the path for the current module
- path.root = get the path for the root module
[Special Path Variable](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/references#filesystem-and-workspace-info)


resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket
  key    = "index.html"
  source = "${path.root}/public/index.html"
}

## Terraform Locals

Terraform Locals are named values which can be assigned and used in your code. It mainly serves the purpose of reducing duplication within the Terraform code. When you use Locals in the code, since you are reducing duplication of the same value, you also increase the readability of the code.

```
locals {
  s3_origin_id = "myS3Origin"
}
```

***[Terraform Locals](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals)***


## Terraform Data Sources

Data sources allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration. For example, your AWS Account ID, list of IPs exposed by your cloud provider etc...

```
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

output "account_id" {
  value = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
}
```

***[Terraform Data Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)***

## JSON Format

jsonencode encodes a given value to a string using JSON syntax. 

```
> jsonencode({"hello"="world"})
{"hello":"world"}
```

It is helpful in creation of the json policy. 

***[jsonencode Function](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode)***

### Changing the Lifecycle of Resources

[Meta Arguments Lifcycle](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)


## Terraform Data

Plain data values such as Local Values and Input Variables don't have any side-effects to plan against and so they aren't valid in replace_triggered_by. You can use terraform_data's behavior of planning an action each time input changes to indirectly use a plain value to trigger replacement.
[Terraform Data](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/terraform-data)


## Provisioners

Provisioners allow you to execute commands on compute instances eg. a AWS CLI command.

They are not recommended for use by Hashicorp because Configuration Management tools such as Ansible are a better fit, but the functionality exists.

[Provisioners](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)

### Local-exec

This will execute command on the machine running the terraform commands eg. plan apply

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
  }
}
```

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec

### Remote-exec

This will execute commands on a machine which you target. You will need to provide credentials such as ssh to get into the machine.

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Establishes connection to be used by all
  # generic remote provisioners (i.e. file/remote-exec)
  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}
```
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec

## For Each Expressions

For each allows us to enumerate over complex data types

```sh
[for s in var.list : upper(s)]
```

This is mostly useful when you are creating multiples of a cloud resource and you want to reduce the amount of repetitive terraform code.
